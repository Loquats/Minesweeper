Minesweeper Game
------------------

This is the classic Windows game Minesweeper.
It's adapted from my Conway's project, and the structure is very similar. 

TODO:
Notify user when they win (Losing already works.)
Add option to change grid size

Notes:
LoadImageApp.java isn't part of the project. Just created to test out image loading when I first learned to use external images.
